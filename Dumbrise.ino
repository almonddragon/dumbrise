// WAKE UP TO LIGHT ALARM
// Right now just keeping this dumb.
// As soon as it gets power, the wake-up animation plays
// 24 hours later it plays the animation again
// So you "set" the alarm by plugging in the power at the same time you want it to go off tomorrow

// Here are the current steps:
// Fade from 0 to full brightness of white channel
  // Eventually I'd like to change colors over the course of this to be more like a sunrise
  // Start with low-intensity red, go through yellow and finish as bright as possible
  // I suspect this would be easier to achieve in an HSV space, but I haven't figured out which library to grab nor how to use it
// Pause at full brightness for specific count of milliseconds -I haven't figured this out-
// Fade back down to zero brightness (ideally faster than it does now)
// Green wipe animation - I'm just using this as a feedback mechansim atm.
// I think it can also be a way to visualize the 23-ish hour delay

//   NEO_KHZ400  400 KHz (classic 'v1' (not v2) FLORA pixels, WS2811 drivers)
//   NEO_GRB     Pixels are wired for GRB bitstream (most NeoPixel products)
